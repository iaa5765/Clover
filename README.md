# Flutter - Ponychan browser for Android  

Flutter is a fast Android app for browsing [Ponychan](https://www.ponychan.net/). It is forked from [Clover](https://floens.github.io/Clover/)  
Clover adds inline replying, thread watching, notifications, themes, pass support, filters and a whole lot more. Clover and Flutter are licensed under the GPL and will always be free.
